# Python Examples

These examples utilize the Requests library to communicate with the Aerospike REST Client.

## Prerequisites

* [Install the Aerospike Rest Client](https://www.aerospike.com/docs/client/rest/install/index.html)
* Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## The Examples

The files contained in the `basic/` folder are standalone single file demo applications demonstrating basic usage of some of the REST Client features.

The code in `demo-app/` presents a simplified example of building a more complex application around the functionality of the REST Client.

The examples assume that the REST Client is listening on `localhost:8080` if it is running elsewhere, the code snippets will need to be modified.
